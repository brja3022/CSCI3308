<b>Project for Software Development (CSCI 3308).</b> <br />
We are making an online Transpiler that converts C to Python code. <br />
(Still under development) <br />

<b> Languages used: </b> SQL, C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 



open mysql workbench
type these sequentially
    create database functionDB;
    use functionDB;
    
copy and paste all code from the scripts.sql file in the database folder
Execute the code;

run command prompt
cd into the folder CSCI3308\Website\resources\js

run command
    node my_scripts.js

you should see a message saying Connected!
keep this window running

open the file index.html in chrome from the folder ..\Website\resources\views

from there you can try out your code fragments in the input box. go easy on the python if, it's buggy
